<h1>Hello Sophia</h1>
  <p>I am driven by a need to create. I want to contribute in whatever I do, whether that be in the creation of a product or in the forming of the ideal reality I'd like to see in our world.I am motivated by a sense of justice. The idea of right and wrong is very important to me, and I enjoy dwelling in the grey areas between the two and discovering where my ethical reasoning creates parameters that offer a coherent worldview. Beyond the theoretical, I believe it is my responsibility to find applications of justice in the world around me, and to correct injustice when I find it. I also enjoy creating beauty around me, and see this as an application of ethics.</p>
